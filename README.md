# TopoJSON/GeoJSON Quick Preview

Use this to quickly preview your TopoJSON or GeoJSON files. Drag a file onto the window, then pan and zoom to your hearts content!
Drop another file on the window and it will replace the existing one, but keep the same pan/zoom. This is great for tuning simplification and/or comparing features in place.

```bash
$ npm install

$ bower install

$ grunt serve
```
