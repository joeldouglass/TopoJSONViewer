# TopoJSON Quick Preview

Use this to quickly preview your TopoJSON files. Drag a TopoJSON file onto the window, then pan and zoom to your hearts content!
Drop another TopoJSON on the window and it will replace the existing one, but keep the same pan/zoom. This is great for tuning simplification and/or comparing features in place.

```bash
$ npm install

$ bower install

$ grunt serve
```
